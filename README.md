MiniMemoryTester

This started out as a simple assembly loop to test memory locations, but as more and more configuration options were added, it all had to be rewritten in a more generalized way.  This tester sacrifices a good amount of speed for configurability. Still, there are lots of places where the code could be greatly sped up.

Build with Merlin32, boot from ProDOS.
